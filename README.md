# Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments
project from Design and Analysis of Experiments

## Overview
A study is conducted on an experiment to figure out the problem: how does the distance between the hand and the head of the chopstick (10 cm vs. 15 cm) and the sides of hands (ie. left or right) affect the total time needed to pick up all red beans in a bowl by chopsticks? The significance of the experiment is that it can demonstrate the dexterity difference of my different hand to inform me of the development levels of different parts of my brain preliminarily, since different parts of brains have specific functions to control different parts of our body.

## Methods
* Used factorial design, performed 20 experiments in total, two distances of 15cm and 10cm are set between the thumb and the chopstick head
* Took influence factors into considerations and tried to eliminate other factors
* Constructed linear model, interaction plot, QQ plot, confidence intervals, and T-tests etc.

## Conclusions and Discussions
Overall, there exist differences with the effects in left-or-right-hand cases and the two distance cases. The right hand tends to pick up beans faster than the left hand and 10 cm distance benefits more than 15 cm distance. However, in order to reach a more precise result, more experiments are needed, since
the dataset is not large enough in my study with only two factors at two levels and 20 experiments in all.
